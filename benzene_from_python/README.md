#  ISDF Calculation of Benzene With PYSCF

This NB computes a grid, MOs (wave functions) and interpolation points using PYSCF, for benzene with a minimal basis

It then exports reference quantities for comparison with those generated by the equivalent fortran code.

Note that the reference quantities appear to differ each time the code is run, suggesting that perhaps one obtains a different linear combination of MOs per run.

Rather than copy the NB and dependencies here, initially just point to it on [Github](https://github.com/AlexBuccheri/isdf_prototypes/blob/main/jupyter/interpolation_points/isdf_export_terms.ipynb)
